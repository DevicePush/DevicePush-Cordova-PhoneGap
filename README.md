# Device Push Notification Plugin

## DESCRIPTION

This plugin is for use with [Cordova](http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/), and allows your application to receive push notifications on Android and iOS devices.
* The Android implementation uses [Google's GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) service](http://developer.android.com/guide/google/gcm/index.html).
* The iOS version is based on [Apple APNS Notifications](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ApplePushService/ApplePushService.html).

**Important** - Push notifications are intended for real devices. The registration process will fail on the iOS simulator. Notifications can be made to work on the Android Emulator, however doing so requires installation of some helper libraries, as outlined [here,](http://www.androidhive.info/2012/10/android-push-notifications-using-google-cloud-messaging-gcm-php-and-mysql/) under the section titled "Installing helper libraries and setting up the Emulator".

##<a name="automatic_installation"></a>Automatic Installation

Below are the methods for installing this plugin automatically using command line tools. For additional info, take a look at the [Plugman Documentation](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman/blob/master/README.md) and [Cordova Plugin Specification](https://github.com/alunny/cordova-plugin-spec).

This requires phonegap/cordova 5.0+

### Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS

### Platforms Under Development

- WP8

### Cordova and PhoneGap CLI

The plugin can be installed via the Cordova command line interface:

1) Navigate to the root folder for your phonegap project. 

2) Run the command:

```sh
cordova plugin add https://github.com/DevicePush/DevicePush-Cordova-PhoneGap
```

### PhoneGap Build

The plugin can be installed via PhoneGap Build:

1) Open config.xml file of your project. 

2) Add this line:

```xml
<gap:plugin name="com.devicepush.cordova-phonegap" source="npm" version="0.2.7" />
```

##<a name="plugin_api"></a> Plugin API

#### Whitelist
Add *.devicepush.com domain in the config.xml file:
```xml
<access origin="*.devicepush.com"></access>
```

#### To register a new device
When the device is ready, you must call the register function.
```js
    var app = {
        initialize: function() {
            this.bindEvents();
        },
        bindEvents: function() {
            document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);
        },
        onDeviceReady: function() {
            app.receivedEvent('deviceready');
            devicePush.register({
                idUser: 'USER_ID', // Your User ID in Device Push
                idApplication: 'APPLICATION_ID', // Aplication ID in Device Push
                position: true // Activate or deactivate gps position record. Default value is false
            });
        },
        receivedEvent: function(id) {}
    };
```

You can manage notifications received with the next method
```js
    devicePush.notificationReceived(function(data) {
        // data.message, 
        // data.title, 
        // data.count, 
        // data.sound, 
        // data.additionalData
        console.log(data.message) // data is your text sent
    });
```

You can get the device id or token of the device.
```js
    document.addEventListener("deviceRegistered",successDeviceRegistered,false);

    function successDeviceRegistered(evt){
        console.log("Device Id" + evt.devicePushId);
        var id = evt.devicePushId;
        console.log("Device Token" + evt.devicePushToken);
        var tokenDevice = evt.devicePushToken;
    }
```

You can activate or deactivate gps position record.
```js
    devicePush.setPosition(true); //Active gps position record, true o false. Default value is false.
```

With this ID you can send notification from your server.

#### successHandler
Called when a plugin method returns without error

```js
    // result contains any message sent from the plugin call
    // Coming soon
```

#### errorHandler
Called when the plugin returns an error

```js
    // result contains any error description text returned from the plugin call
    // Coming soon
```

Looking at the above message handling code for Android, a few things bear explanation. Your app may receive a notification while it is active (INLINE). If you background the app by hitting the Home button on your device, you may later receive a status bar notification. Selecting that notification from the status will bring your app to the front and allow you to process the notification (BACKGROUND). Finally, should you completely exit the app by hitting the back button from the home page, you may still receive a notification. Touching that notification in the notification tray will relaunch your app and allow you to process the notification (COLDSTART). In this case the **coldstart** flag will be set on the incoming event. You can look at the **foreground** flag on the event to determine whether you are processing a background or an in-line notification. You may choose, for example to play a sound or show a dialog only for inline or coldstart notifications since the user has already been alerted via the status bar.

Since the Android notification data models are much more flexible than that of iOS, there may be additional elements beyond **message**. You can access those elements and any additional ones via the **payload** element. This means that if your data model should change in the future, there will be no need to change and recompile the plugin.
